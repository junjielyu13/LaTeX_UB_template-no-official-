# Contributing to UB TEMPLATE

üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to **UB Latex Template**. These are just guidelines, not rules, use your best judgment and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Issues

Issues are created [here](https://github.com/junjielyu13/LaTeX_UB_template-no-official-/issues).

- How to Contribute in Issues
- Asking for General Help
- Submitting a Bug Report
- Triaging a Bug Report
- Resolving a Bug Report

## Languages

We accept issues in any language. When an issue is posted in a language besides English, it is acceptable and encouraged to post an English-translated copy as a reply. Anyone may post the translated reply. In most cases, a quick pass through translation software is sufficient. Having the original text as well as the translation can help mitigate translation errors.

## Pull Requests

- Setting up your local environment

  - Step 1: Fork

    Fork the project on GitHub and clone your fork locally.

        $ git clone git@github.com:username/LaTeX_UB_template-no-official-.git
        $ cd LaTeX_UB_template-no-official-
        $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/junjielyu13/LaTeX_UB_template-no-official-.git
        $ git fetch upstream

  - Step 2: Branch

    Make sure create local branches to hold your work. These should be branched directly off of the main branch.

        $ git checkout -b my-branch -t upstream/main

- Making Changes

  - Step 3: Code

        Make your changes

  - Step 4: Commit

    It is recommended to keep your changes grouped logically within individual commits. Many contributors find it easier to review changes that are split across multiple commits. There is no limit to the number of commits in a pull request.

        $ git add my/changed/files
        $ git commit

    Note that multiple commits get squashed when they are landed.

  - Step 5: Rebase

    Once you have committed your changes, it is a good idea to use git rebase (not git merge) to synchronize your work with the main repository

        $ git fetch upstream

        $ git rebase upstream/main

  - Step 6: Push

    Once your commits are ready to go -- with passing tests and linting -- begin the process of opening a pull request by pushing your working branch to your fork on GitHub.

        $ git push origin my-branch

  - Step 7: Opening the Pull Request

    From within GitHub, opening a new pull request will present you with a template that should be filled out. It can be found [here](https://github.com/junjielyu13/LaTeX_UB_template-no-official-/pulls).

    If you do not adequately complete this template, your PR may be delayed in being merged as maintainers seek more information or clarify ambiguities.

  - Step 8: Discuss and Update

    You will probably get feedback or requests for changes to your pull request. This is a big part of the submission process so don't be discouraged! Some contributors may sign off on the pull request right away. Others may have detailed comments or feedback. This is a necessary part of the process in order to evaluate whether the changes are correct and necessary.

    To make changes to an existing pull request, make the changes to your local branch, add a new commit with those changes, and push those to your fork. GitHub will automatically update the pull request.

        $ git add my/changed/files

        $ git commit

        $ git push origin my-branch

    There are a number of more advanced mechanisms for managing commits using git rebase that can be used, but are beyond the scope of this guide.
