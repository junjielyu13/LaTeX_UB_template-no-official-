## Pull Requests

- Setting up your local environment

  - Step 1: Fork

    Fork the project on GitHub and clone your fork locally.

        $ git clone git@github.com:username/electron.git
        $ cd electron
        $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/electron/electron.git
        $ git fetch upstream

  - Step 2: Branch

    Make sure create local branches to hold your work. These should be branched directly off of the main branch.

        $ git checkout -b my-branch -t upstream/main

- Making Changes

  - Step 3: Code

  - Step 4: Commit

    It is recommended to keep your changes grouped logically within individual commits. Many contributors find it easier to review changes that are split across multiple commits. There is no limit to the number of commits in a pull request.

        $ git add my/changed/files
        $ git commit

    Note that multiple commits get squashed when they are landed.
